Windows down on the astral highway\
asphalt unfolds before us\
lights illuminate the void

Here I am\
Pull me into the abyss

Falling forward at a million miles per minute\
stung by a cold headwind\
sucked down that line

where do I go?\
where have I been?

The line pans into me\
ripping at the speed of light\
it goes through me\
straight into the depths

white blurs against nothing\
it beats\
each bump stamps myself\
lulling me into the rhythm

oomf - oomf - oomf - oomf\
I feel it now\
one path, one speed\
all options fall but unto one

we're here\
we've arrived\
without leaving\
without arriving

yes! the line gives!\
thank you for being\
the one thing that's always been\
we will follow you into the abyss!
